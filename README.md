motif based hypergraph structure summarization

In this repository we propose a node aggregation based method for hypergraph summarization. The algorithm relies on higher order motifs discovery. In order to find higher order motifs in a hypergraph we use the algorithmic solution proposed by Quintino Francesco Lotito et al. in their [implementation](https://github.com/FraLotito/higher-order-motifs.git).
